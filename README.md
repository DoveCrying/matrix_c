### Matrix Effect written in C 
#### Why did I do this?
I wanted to get some practice utilising C, and after seeing a cool library in brew (called cmatrix), I though it would have been cool to try and recreate such an effect. Furthermore, I am still getting the hang on using github correctly, alongside creating legible README.md files, so this can work as further excercise.

#### Methodology
The project has mainly been created using the curses.h library.
